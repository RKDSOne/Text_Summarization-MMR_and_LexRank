He has remained in office as caretaker prime minister since Lahoud succeeded Hrawi on Tuesday.
There has been no formal announcement from Lahoud reappointing Hariri as prime minister.
The amendment to Article 49 of the constitution revokes a ban on senior civil servants from running for the presidency.
Among those who were absent was Walid Jumblatt, a Cabinet minister who had said he would boycott the session to protest the choice of a military man even though Lahoud has wide public and political support.
Hariri, Lebanon's top businessman, has almost single-handedly created a multibillion dollar program to rebuild a country destroyed by the civil war.
