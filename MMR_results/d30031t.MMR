For the second day in a row, astronauts boarded space shuttle Endeavour on Friday for liftoff on NASA's first space station construction flight.
It took several tries, however, for Zarya and Unity to be pulled tightly together.
The problem was confined to one of Endeavour's three hydraulic pressure units.
The work is further complicated by international politics and worries about money.
As construction goes on outside, the astronauts inside Endeavour will be busy making preparations to enter the new station through a connecting tunnel and docking system.
The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity, the first American-made component, will serve as a connecting passageway, or vestibule, for future modules.
