Saudi dissident Osama Bin Laden is wanted by U.S. officials for those attacks.
Ms. White said bin Laden was charged with "plotting and carrying out the most heinous acts of international terrorism and murder."
The skirmishing continued in court.
"It is a challenge to the entire Muslim world ... Bin Laden is a hero of the Muslim world," said Omar Warsi, a leader of Pakistan's militant Sunni Muslim group, Sipah-e-Sahaba, or Guardians of the Friends of the Prophet.
Harakat is considered a strong supporter of bin Laden, and several Harakat followers were killed in the U.S. missile attack on alleged bin Laden terror sites in Afghanistan.
