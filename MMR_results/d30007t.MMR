Kabila has turned Kindu into a launching pad for a counteroffensive against rebel positions in eastern Congo.
He quickly changed the name of the country to Congo, from Zaire.
In the capital, Kinshasa, the private Congolese Airlines, which owned the aircraft, said the victims were civilians fleeing fighting in Kindu.
Kalunga said the airport, although still under government control, was in effect unoperational because of the rebel surface-to-air-missiles deployed nearby.
After an eight-month rebellion backed by Rwanda and Uganda, dictator Mobutu Sese Seko fled in May 1997, and Kabila took power.
The rebels are a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of Kabila's army and political opponents who accuse Kabila of power-grabbing, mismanagement, corruption and sowing dissent among Congo's 400 tribes.
