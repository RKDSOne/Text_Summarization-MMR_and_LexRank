Prodi has said he would call a confidence vote if he lost the Communists' support.
"I've always acted with coherence," Prodi said before a morning meeting with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro on the crisis.
Prodi's far-left ally, the Communist Refoundation Party, provoked the crisis by withdrawing its support over the weekend and saying it would not vote for his deficit-cutting 1999 budget, which is key to Italy's participation in the European common currency.
Mauro Zani, a spokesman for the Democratic Party of the Left, the main party in Prodi's coalition, called the decision by Communist Refounding a "misfortune for the entire country."
