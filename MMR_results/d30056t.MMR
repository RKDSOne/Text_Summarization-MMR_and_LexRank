The severed heads of the four men were found lined up along a highway Tuesday outside Chechnya's capital Grozny, and hundreds of Chechen law enforcement officers were searching for the bodies Wednesday.
Maskhadov said Chechen officials had caught one of the captors Monday and he told police where the hostages were being held.
The European Union Wednesday condemned the slaying of four foreign hostages in Chechnya and said it would raise the issue with Russia's foreign minister.
Their heads were found Tuesday on a highway about 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Grozny.
In another mine explosion, a tractor driver was killed Thursday in the republic, the Interfax news agency reported, citing Chechnya's security officials.
