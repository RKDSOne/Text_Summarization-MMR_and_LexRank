"The problem is so bad that it is only a little worse in North Korea," Davies said.
Although hard figures are not yet available, the prospects for this year are that "the harvest will not be any better," Ngongi told reporters in Beijing after visiting North Korea.
The grain harvest is finished and by U.N. estimates little improved over last year's: about 3 million tons, only enough to meet two-thirds of the needs of North Korea's 22 million people.
North Korea needs a minimum 4.5 million to 5 million tons of grain to feed its 23 million people, but managed last year to harvest just 2.8 million tons, Namanga Ngongi, deputy head of the World Food Program said.
