Built by a Russian company and to be launched atop a Russian booster rocket, the 24-ton Zarya (Sunrise) control and cargo module is a U.S.-funded component of the station.
Minutes after Zarya's capture, Cabana called down that two antennas on the module were still undeployed as Russian flight controllers had feared.
Russian Space Agency general director Yuri Koptev told reporters the maneuver was carried out "with great accuracy," and the 24-ton core module was cruising through space without any problems.
Mission Control ordered the pilots to fire the shuttle thrusters to put an extra three miles between Endeavour and the space junk, putting Endeavour a total of five miles from the orbiting debris.
