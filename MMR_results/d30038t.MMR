Hodler said a group of four agents, including one IOC member, have been involved in promising votes for payment.
The committee which won the 1998 games for Nagano "certainly had to do things which are not legitimate," Hodler said.
He declined to identify them.
He also said that his commission would expand its inquiry beyond the Salt Lake City bid only if it was presented with evidence and not simply rumors of corruption in other bids.
"We trust the organizing committee of Salt Lake City."
Hodler added that the agents then charge the city winning the bid "something like dlrs 3 million to dlrs 5 millon."
