Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy are out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman Hun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying to make its members' return an international issue.
The ruling party accused U.S. policy-makers of not taking timely action to save the Cambodian people from the Khmer Rouge.
Senior FUNCINPEC official Ahmad Yahya revealed Monday that it was also agreed that the CPP would control the foreign affairs and finance portfolios.
The prince's party, in a statement dated Friday and seen Saturday, said such a scenario was unconstitutional.
