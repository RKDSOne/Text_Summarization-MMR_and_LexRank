Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it the following year.
Representatives of exiled East Timorese pro-independence groups said Friday that Indonesian troops attacked unarmed civilians in a village in the disputed Southeast Asian territory, killing one East Timorese and wounding 22 others.
"I said there was a lot of tension in East Timor and that he and his people ought to do everything they can to reduce it," said Marker, a former Pakistani ambassador to the United Nations.
Talks were revived earlier this year after the ouster of authoritarian President Suharto, but differences remain over a definition of autonomy that would suit all parties.
