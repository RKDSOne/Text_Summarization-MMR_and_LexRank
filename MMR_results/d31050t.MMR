He has told police interrogators he expects to be jailed, likely for a few years less than the 13 given China Democracy Party leader Xu Wenli on Monday.
After a trial that lasted just three and a half hours, Xu Wenli _ at 55 the dean of the dissident movement, and a man who has already spent 12 years in prison for advocating democracy _ was sentenced to 13 years for "subversion of state power."
"And if I die," Xu said as they parted that day, "please plant a tree for me."
In its manifestoes, the Democracy Party espoused peaceful means to target "the undemocratic system, not the political power of the Communist Party."
