Zejnije Delijaj, 39, who had cooked for the guerrillas at the family compound when they returned from fighting in the days before the massacre, recalled how she fled, crawling, falling, running and hiding in the woods as the Serbs shot at her. The Hague's prosecutors could also draw on the observations of diplomats, human rights monitors and reporters who saw the bodies scattered in the ravine where the victims were killed before they were buried in shallow graves in the clan's nearby compound. Ivo Daalder, a former Bosnia expert on the National Security Council, now with the Brookings Institution, said the arrest showed a new and promising coordination between the Tribunal and NATO troops, given the rapid arrest after the Oct. 30 indictment. At the outset of the war in 1992, he was an officer of the Yugoslav Army, and like all senior Bosnian Serb officers, was transferred to the new Bosnian Serb force. ``Blood was in her mouth and her mother's hand on the baby,'' said Imer Delijaj, the father, an avowed member of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the ethnic Albanian guerrilla force, who returned in uniform to discover the bodies. As the Serbs approached on foot the Saturday morning of the massacre, the last person to flee the compound itself was Bashkim Delijaj, 21, the youngest son of 94-year-old Fazli.
