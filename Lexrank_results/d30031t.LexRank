Endeavour and its astronauts closed in Sunday to capture the first piece of the international space station, the Russian-made Zarya control module that had to be connected to the Unity chamber aboard the shuttle. The United States and 15 other nations plan to begin building the new station in orbit next week when the Russians launch a module that will supply power and propulsion during the early stages of the five-year construction period. The project entails high risk, because of the technical difficulty of putting all this together in the unforgiving environment of space, along with the dangers inherent in flying the space shuttle to the construction site. The astronauts will use the shuttle robot arm to capture the Russian space station piece and attach it to Unity. Saturday, one of the astronauts, Lt. Col. Nancy Currie of the Army, is to have the shuttle's robot arm hoist Unity from the payload bay and secure it to Endeavour's docking system, moving the unit from a horizontal to a vertical position. The docking ring between them would not retract properly; Mission Control quickly traced the problem to the attached robot arm and asked the crew to release its hold on the docked Zarya.
