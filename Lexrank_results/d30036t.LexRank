Saramago, whose sense of literary freedom is evident in his unconventional punctuation and conflicting use of tenses, sought a different form of freedom in ``The Stone Raft,'' where he imagines the confusion unleashed when the Iberian peninsula suddenly breaks free from the rest of Europe and begins drifting toward the New World and threatens to collide with the Azores. In the 1989 ``The History of the Siege of Lisbon,'' a Lisbon proofreader mischievously inserts the word ``not'' into a text on the 12th century capture of the Portuguese capital from the Moors, thereby fictionally altering the course of European history with a stroke of his pen. This fantastic story takes place against the very real background of the tortuous construction of the massive Mafra Convent by thousands of men held in the grip of the Inquisition. ``The History of the Siege of Lisbon,'' published in the United States last year, is a whimsical tale set in motion by the decision of a humble proofreader at a publishing house to insert the word ``not'' into a key passage in a standard history of Portugal. Regarding the future, Saramago said the book he is currently working on will be called ``The Cavern'' and deals with a modern version of myth of Plato and the cave. ``The choice could be interpreted as being motivated partly by politics,'' given the poet's association with China's democracy movement, ``but it's clear he's a wonderful poet.''
