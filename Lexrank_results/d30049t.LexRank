But if the United States determines that North Korea has revived its nuclear program, Rubin said, ``it would go against the entire letter and spirit of the objectives of the agreement, and it would affect the viability of the agreement.'' American officials have said spy satellites have recently photographed thousands of North Koreans around the huge site 25 miles northeast of Yongbyon, the nuclear center where North Korea was believed to have stockpiled enough plutonium before the 1994 accords to build six or more bombs. The North Korean representative at the United Nations, Kim Chang Guk, said last week that the United States could inspect the site ``on condition that when it is confirmed not to be a nuclear facility, the United States should pay compensation for slandering and defaming my country.'' He called for full access for U.S. inspectors at a North Korean underground facility and said the North must not develop missiles. North Korea has said that it will show off the complex only if Washington promises that if the complex is not a nuclear one, it will pay for ``vilifying us and impairing our prestige.'' It forms the backbone of the North Korean government, with leader Kim Jong Il ruling the country as the head of the military.
