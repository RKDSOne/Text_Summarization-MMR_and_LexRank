A leaflet signed by the group and faxed to Reuters in Jerusalem said the ``heroic attack,'' in which 24 people were injured and the 2 bombers killed, had been carried out ``to confront the great conspiracy that aims to liquidate the Palestinian cause through the Oslo and Wye Plantation agreements of submission.'' The two bombers who carried out Friday's attack, which led the Israeli Cabinet to suspend deliberations on the land-for-security accord signed with the Palestinians last month, were identified as members of Islamic Holy War from West Bank villages under Israeli security control. On a warm, sunny morning last Friday, at the time he usually left for work at his family's produce store, Youssef Sughayer said goodbye to his grandmother for the last time and rode off to his death. Two people were killed and 21 others were wounded in the attack for which the Islamic militant group Hamas claimed responsibility. ``He went to work at the grocery store, he finished his high school classes and he wanted to enroll in the university. In response to the attack, the Israeli cabinet suspended ratification of the Wye agreement until there ``is verification that the Palestinian authority is indeed fighting terrorism.''
