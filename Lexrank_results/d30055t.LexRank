The latest threat to the government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi came after delegates to a two-day conference of the Communist Refounding Party voted to reject the government's proposed 1999 budget, imperiling the future of the center-left coalition. Mauro Zani, a spokesman for the Democratic Party of the Left, the main party in Prodi's coalition, called the decision by Communist Refounding a ``misfortune for the entire country.'' The coalition has a majority without the Communists in the Senate, but has depended on them for passage of key legislation in the Chamber. If the Communist Refounding's parliamentary deputies abide by the resolution, which passed by a vote of 188-112, it will destabilize Italy's government at a time when the outcome of the recent election in Germany has already injected a note of uncertainty into the future of European economic and fiscal policy. Prodi's far-left ally, the Communist Refoundation Party, provoked the crisis by withdrawing its support over the weekend and saying it would not vote for his deficit-cutting 1999 budget, which is key to Italy's participation in the European common currency. In June, the hard-line leftists again refused to follow the prime minister, that time in a Parliament vote for NATO expansion, but the government muddled through with the help of Cossiga's party.
