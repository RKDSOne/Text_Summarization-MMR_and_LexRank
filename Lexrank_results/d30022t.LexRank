The letter called for the release of Shi Binhai, a journalist who compiled a popular book on political change; Fang Jue, a businessman who called openly for political reform; and other imprisoned activists. One leader of a suppressed new political party will be tried on Dec. 17 on a charge of colluding with foreign enemies of China ``to incite the subversion of state power,'' according to court documents given to his wife on Monday. In the Chinese criminal code, this charge comes under a grab-bag section called ``threatening state security,'' which makes almost any political activity that questions or hampers the authority of the Communist Party illegal, from ``violent or nonviolent activities aimed at overthrowing the government authorities,'' to ``activities designed to change the basic nature of the state.'' He said he had no information from Chinese authorities about Qin or Wang. A third leading advocate of the China Democracy Party who has been in custody for a month, Wang Youcai, was accused of ``inciting the overthrow of the government,'' the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported. ``Whether he has a lawyer or not, whatever he says, the government has already decided,'' Hu Jiangxia said.
